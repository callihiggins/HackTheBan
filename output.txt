Federal law enforcement agencies like the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) have a dark
history of targeting radical and
progressive movements. Some of
the dirty tricks they use against
these movements include: infiltration of organizations to discredit
and disrupt their operations;
campaigns of misinformation and
false stories in the media; forgery
of correspondence; fabrication
of evidence; and the use of grand
jury subpoenas to intimidate activists. Today's activist must know
and understand the threat posed
by federal law enforcement agents
and their tactics as well as several
key security practices that offer
the best protection.
Federal agents have many tools at
their disposal to target activists.
While it is important to know and
understand these tools and tactics,
it is of critical importance that you
resist any paranoia of government
surveillance or fear of infiltration,
which will only serve to paralyze
you or your organization in your
quest for social change. If fear of
government repression prevents
you from organizing, the agents of
repression will have won without
even trying.
The Center for Constitutional
Rights (CCR) created If an Agent
Knocks to provide advice to activists likely to be targeted by FBI
agents or other federal investigators. Since its original release in
1989, If an Agent Knocks has been
widely circulated in progressive
activist communities across the
country. This guide includes both
the timeless advice included in
the original version and extensive
updates to reflect the current state
of the law and law enforcement
tools. This updated edition also
includes a comprehensive discussion of today's technology, including cell phones, e-mail and Web
browsing. This guide should be
seen as a resource for the information needed to protect yourself and
other activists from government
investigation and to empower you
to continue the struggle.
We have attempted to provide
answers to a broad range of questions for the many scenarios that
one can encounter as an activist.
We hope individuals and groups
use this pamphlet to develop and
prepare practical responses � if
an agent knocks at your door.
This publication consistently
emphasizes that professional legal
advice should be sought in all
cases. The Center for Constitutional Rights does not have the capacity to provide individual criminal
representation.
Each state has bar associations
that should be able to make attorney referrals, some of whom
may provide pro-bono services. If
there is a chapter of the National
Lawyers Guild (www.nlg.org) in
your city, they are often able to
make referrals to attorneys who
are experienced in dealing with
the issues outlined in this booklet.

If I Am
Approached
or Called
by a Law
Enforcement
Agent, Do I
Have to Talk?

This is the most important piece of
information in this booklet: you
have the right to remain silent,
and it is usually the best idea to
do so. The Fifth Amendment of
the United States Constitution
protects you from being forced to
reveal self-incriminating information to
law enforcement.
This is easier to say
than to do. Agents are
trained investigators:
they have learned
the power of persuasion and the ability to make a person
feel scared, guilty or
impolite for refusing
their requests for information.
An agent may suggest that any
unwillingness to speak with her/
him means you must have something to hide. S/he may suggest s/
he only wants you to answer a few
questions and then s/he will leave
you alone. The agent may threaten
to get a warrant.
Don't be intimidated or manipulated by an agent's threats or assurances. It is always best to not
talk without an attorney present. If
you do talk, anything you say can
be used against you and others.
Even if you tell the whole truth, if
the agent doesn't believe you, s/
he can threaten to charge you with
lying to a federal officer � which is a real
crime.
Clearly convey your
intention to remain
silent. Say "I'm not
talking to you," or
"I'd like to talk to my
lawyer before I say
anything to you." You
can also say, "I have
nothing to say to you.
I will talk to my lawyer and have
her/him contact you." You should
ask the agent for a business card
and say you will have your lawyer
contact them. This should end the
questioning.
The one exception to this rule
is if you are in a state that has a
"stop-and-identify" statute. All
states require you to produce a
drivers license if you are pulled
over while driving an automobile,
and the Supreme Court has held
that laws that require you to state
basic identifying information, such
as your name and address, are not
considered incriminating and that
law enforcement may demand
such information you. They may
only demand that information
from you, however, if you are in a
state that has a stop-and-identify
statute. An activist attorney in your
state should be able to tell you if
your state has a stop-and-identify
statute.
The same basic rules apply if an
agent calls on the phone. You do
not have to speak to any agent who
spontaneously calls you. Agents
will often say that you are not part
of any investigation. This may
not be the truth. Tell anyone who
identifies themselves as law enforcement that you will have your
lawyer call them back � and then
stop talking to them.
If possible, get the agent's name,
telephone number and agency.
This should be on her/his business
card, or s/he should be willing to
provide this information.
As soon as the agent leaves or
hangs up, try to write down as
many details about the interaction
as you can. This information will
be useful to a lawyer and to others
who have been contacted by law
enforcement. Try to write down
the name of the agent(s) and her/
his physical description; the type
of car the agent was driving; the
questions asked and comments
made during the interaction; the
date, time and location of the encounter; and the contact information of any witnesses.
The best course of action is usually
to get a lawyer involved. A lawyer
can offer advice on how to proceed
while protecting your rights. A
lawyer can talk to the agent; find
out what the investigation is about;
try to set limitations on the subject
matter of any questioning; and be
present to advise and protect you
if you are questioned. Sometimes a
call from a lawyer is all it takes to
get an agent to back off.
With the advice of a lawyer, you
may consider publicizing the
encounter to others who may be affected by an investigation. If activists know that there is an investigation, they can be more vigilant in
protecting their rights. Organizing
and public pressure can expose
and limit intimidation and fishing
expeditions.

1. At the time of publishing, the following states have some version of a stop-and-identify statute: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont
and Wisconsin.

What Are The Consequences If I Do Talk?

A situation may arise where you
feel it is advisable to talk to an
agent. Perhaps you have been the
victim of a crime or you are a witness to civil rights violations being
prosecuted by the federal government.
Even in those circumstances, you
should have a lawyer present. A
lawyer can make sure your rights
are protected while you provide
only necessary information relevant to a specific incident. They
may be able to help you avoid
a witness' appearance before a
grand jury or control the circumstances of the appearance so that
no one's rights are jeopardized.
If you do decide to answer questions, be aware that lying to a
government official is a crime. In
fact, one of the most important
reasons to not talk to an agent is
this crime. A standard federal law
enforcement tactic is to discover
as much information as possible
about a suspect or merely a person
of interest to the government.
Federal law enforcement agents
will then approach that person at
an otherwise ordinary time, such
as during dinner or at the bus
stop, and ask the person questions
to which they already know the
answers.

For example, an agent might ask
if you know a person (whom they
know that you know) or might ask
if you were at an event (at which
they know you were in attendance).
If you instinctively say "No," that
is a federal felony punishable
with five to eight years in prison.
The most daunting aspect of this
investigative tactic is that many individuals will instinctively answer
no to a question because they are
scared or nervous. This tactic is
used extensively by federal agents
in all types of investigations and
has been used recently to target
and turn activists into informants
against their former associates.
Lying to a federal officer is a
federal offense and only applies to
questions asked by federal agents.
Be aware, however, that some local
and state agents, such as members
of a city's Joint Terrorism Task
Force, are also considered "federal"
agents. As well, some states have
similar crimes regarding lying to
a state officer. The safest choice is
not to talk to law enforcement.
If you start answering questions,
you can refuse to continue answering questions at any time.


Never allow law enforcement to
search your person or property
without a warrant. Law enforcement agents are required to have
a warrant to search your property
except for certain limited circumstances. You are only legally
required to allow law enforcement
agents into your home, office or
other private space if they have a
warrant.
Agents may search your house
without a warrant if you allow
them to, and they are trained to
seek your consent to warrantless
searches. Be careful of questions
that are designed to elicit your
consent to search. These questions
may be as innocuous as "Do you
mind if I come in?" Simply allowing an agent into your home may
be construed as consent to search
the whole place.
Legally, the best answer to a request to search is "I do not consent
to a search." Say it loudly and
proudly so any witnesses can hear.
What If An Agent Asks
to Search My Home,
Apartment or Office?

A search warrant is a court order authorizing law enforcement
to search a specified location and
seize evidence.
The Fourth Amendment protects
people against unreasonable
searches. Unless an exception
applies, law enforcement agents
are required to obtain a search
warrant to conduct a search.
Search warrants must be supported by probable cause, with
facts sworn to by the officer applying for the warrant. A search
warrant should be specific to
the area to be searched and the
object(s) to be searched for. It
should be signed by a judge, be
dated with a recent date (within
a couple of weeks) and state the
correct address for the location.
Probable cause means that facts
must exist to establish that evidence of a crime will probably be
found in the area to be searched.
Probable cause must be based on
facts � hunches are not enough.
Armed with a search warrant,
law enforcement agents have the
right to search your property.
If you do not grant them access, they will likely use force to
execute the search.
Search Warrants

Tools

A roommate can consent to a
search of common, shared space
and to her/his own space. A roommate cannot consent to search of
another person's private space
in a shared house or apartment.
In other words, a roommate
could consent to a search of your
kitchen, living room or shared
bathroom, but not your private
bedroom, unless you share it with
her/him or it is used as a common
space in some way.
Spouses can consent to the search
of their partner's private rooms
because they are considered to
have shared authority over all
space in the house. Similarly,
parents can consent to a search of
their children's private space. In
sum, if you share a bedroom with
a roommate or partner, they can
consent to a search of that space.
To protect against unwanted
searches, make sure private space
remains private. If you allow
roommates to have mutual access
and control over your private
space, they can consent to a search
of that space. Tell roommates, office mates and anyone with whom
you share space to never consent
to searches of any space, especially
your private space.
What If I'm Not
Around and an Agent
Asks My Roommate to
Search My Property?
Can Agents Search My
Trash?
Once you have placed your trash
outside your house, agents can
search it without a warrant or any
other legal restraint. Courts have
found that you have no privacy
interest in your trash because you
are surrendering it to the general
public. Shred or otherwise destroy
any and all sensitive documents
before disposing of them.


Law enforcement has extremely
broad power to conduct warrantless searches of cars. If an agent
has probable cause to believe that
a car contains evidence of a crime,
the agent may, without a warrant, search the vehicle and any
container inside the vehicle that is
large enough to contain the item
for which s/he had probable cause
to search. For example, if an agent
has probable cause to believe you
stole a large television, s/he can
search the trunk of the car but not
the glove box or a small toolbox in
the trunk. If s/he only has probable cause to search a container
recently placed in the car, s/he can
only search that container.
If you are arrested and your car is
impounded, law enforcement is
allowed to perform a warrantless
inventory search. This basically
means the police may search your
car for the purpose of cataloging
what is inside, but they may use
anything they find against you for
any reason. Inventory searches
must follow local established
procedures, and the police may
not use an inventory search as
pretext for performing a warrantless search.
What Rights Do I Have
to Keep Agents From
Searching My Car?
What If an Agent
Threatens to Get a
Warrant or Grand Jury
Subpoena Unless I
Talk or Consent to a
Search?
What If an Agent
Claims to Have a
Search Warrant?
If an agent claims to have a warrant, ask to see it. It should look
similar to the sample search warrant featured here and must be
signed by a judge to be valid. A
search warrant should be specific
as to the area to be searched and
the object(s) to search for. Do not
consent to an agent searching any
areas not specifically included in a
search warrant.
Just because an agent has a search
warrant doesn't mean you have to
answer any questions. Maintain
your right to silence during the
search � clearly state that intention
Don't be intimidated by an agent's
threats to get a warrant or subpoena. This is one of the oldest tricks
in the book. If it were so easy for
the agent to get a warrant or subpoena, s/he wouldn't have wasted
time trying to get your voluntary
cooperation. Again, simply state
that you will not consent to any
search and that you will not talk
without a lawyer present.
if you are asked any questions.


"Sneak and peek" searches allow the government, with secret approval
from a court, to conduct searches and surveillance without notifying
the subject of the search. Since sneak-and-peek searches are intended to
be carried out secret, they usually are conducted through breaking and
entering.
Normally an agent has to go before a judge and demonstrate probable
cause in order to obtain a search warrant. In the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court, however, agents can obtain authorization to conduct
a sneak-and-peek search if they can demonstrate that the search will
provide foreign intelligence information. And, foreign intelligence gathering doesn't have to be the primary reason for the search; it just has to
be a significant reason for the search. This means that an agent can get
authorization to search your home to gather evidence of criminal acts so
long as foreign intelligence gathering is also a goal in the search.
While sneak-and-peak searches were designed for purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information, most courts have allowed evidence
and information obtained from sneak-and-peek searches to be used in
criminal prosecutions.
"Sneak and Peek" Searches
What Should I Do If
My Office or Home
Is Broken Into and
I Suspect That the
Motive Was Intelligence
Gathering?
If your home or office is broken
into, or if threats have been made
against you, your organization or
someone you work with, share
this information with everyone
affected and take immediate
steps to increase personal and
office security. Contact a lawyer
immediately.

An arrest warrant is a court order authorizing law enforcement to
arrest a specified person. Arrest warrants are signed and issued by a
judge based on sworn applications from law enforcement attesting that
there is probable cause that a crime has been committed and the person
or people named in the warrant committed the crime.
In general, police and other law enforcement agents don't need a warrant to make an arrest. If they have probable cause to believe a crime
has been committed, they can make an arrest.
There are two common exceptions to this rule. First, in most but not all
states, law enforcement agents need a warrant to make an arrest for
a misdemeanor that they did not witness personally. It is important to
note, however, that agents can still make arrests for felonies they did not
witness without an arrest warrant. Secondly, law enforcement generally needs an arrest warrant to make an arrest in your home. They can,
however, make a warrantless arrest in your home if they believe there is
a risk that you will destroy evidence or if they are in chasing you in hot
pursuit and you duck into your or someone else's home.
Arrest Warrant
What Should I Do If
Agents Show Up With
an Arrest Warrant?
An arrest warrant is a tool used by
police and other law enforcement
agents to enter your home to make
an arrest. One of the many loopholes in search warrant requirements is that once the agents are
inside your home, even if they are
there with only an arrest warrant,
they have great leeway to conduct
a search. They can search the immediate area around you without a
search warrant. Law enforcement
agents can even search the whole
house as part of a "protective
sweep" if they have a reasonable
belief that a dangerous person
might be present there.
If law enforcement arrives at your
home (or any other space) with an
arrest warrant, the best thing to do
is go outside and give yourself up.
If it is safe to do so, lock the door
behind you. If law enforcement
agents have an arrest warrant, they
will arrest you. Do not give them
the chance to conduct a warrantless search of your home as well.

A subpoena is an order issued by a government authority that demands
someone turn over physical evidence, such as documents, or that the
person testify in court.
Subpoenas are extremely easy to obtain. They are often filed by a government employee, a court clerk and even private attorneys. A subpoena
does not need to be presented to a judge before it is issued. The showing required to issue a subpoena is extremely low; a subpoena may be
issued if there is any reasonable possibility that the physical evidence
or testimony demanded will provide information relevant to the subject
being investigated.
The ease with which subpoenas are issued makes them a powerful tool,
but unlike search warrants or other government tools, they can be challenged in court prior to compliance. If you receive a subpoena, you can
move to "quash" the subpoena if it is too broad or too burdensome or if
it seeks legally protected materials, including materials protected by the
First Amendment. Once a subpoena is quashed, the documents or testimony demanded are no longer required of the recipient.
Subpoenas are particularly dangerous because law enforcement can
subpoena third parties that may have information about you. The government can subpoena other people for e-mails you have sent them. Or
they can ask your e-mail provider for them. Because these third parties
do not have the same interest in defeating these subpoenas that you do,
and are more likely to comply with the subpoena without a fight.
Subpoenas
What Should I Do If I
Receive a Subpoena?
You should seek to quash the subpoena before the date of compliance specified on the subpoena
itself, but even subpoenas that
state they require immediate compliance cannot be enforced without
a judge.
If someone shows up at your
door and tries to serve you with a
subpoena, just take it. Don't let the
person in, don't answer any questions and don't consent to a search.
A subpoena does not give an agent
the right to take any immediate
action.

You should obtain the services of
an attorney to help you quash the
subpoena.
In the unlikely event that you are
informed that a third party has
been subpoenaed for records about
you, you can move to quash that
subpoena � it does not matter if a
subpoena wasn't issued directly to
you.

Infiltration&
HumanSurveillance
The use of undercover agents and informants is indispensable in investigations by modern law enforcement agencies. The ability to place undercover agents or informants in progressive movements or organizations
gives law enforcement a kind of access that is otherwise nearly impossible to obtain. Infiltration is very useful to collect confidential information on the activities of private individuals and give law enforcement
enough information to initiate an investigation. Undercover agents and
informants can report to law enforcement on the participants, tactics and
actions of movements. They can even suggest, encourage and/or participate in illegal activity in their efforts to arrest participants. Courts have
generally held that public policy forbids the disclosure of an informant's
name unless essential to the defense in a criminal court, so informants
are rarely called upon to testify, enabling them to act with only a limited
amount of responsibility or accountability.
Informants are individuals who are not employed as law enforcement
agents who provide law enforcement agents with information, often in
exchange for money. An informant ordinarily has previous involvement
in � and more intimate knowledge of � the movement or organization
that the agents are investigating.
Informants
Know Their Tools


An undercover agent is a law enforcement officer who uses an assumed
name or fake identity to infiltrate a movement or organization to gather
information or evidence. In political infiltration cases, an agent will
typically pose as a sympathizer to a particular organization, gain the
trust of its key members and then use this access to gather confidential
information to pass on to the investigative agency. A secondary objective may be to lay the groundwork for a separate investigation. Undercover agents typically concoct a cover story as detailed as the assignment requires as well as a basic biography and plausible story covering
past and present activities.
Undercover Agents
Cooperating witnesses are similar to informants, except that
cooperating witnesses usually agree to "flip" or "snitch" after being
threatened with prosecution. Cooperating witnesses will testify in court
in exchange for lesser charges being filed against them if there are any
charges filed against them at all.
Law enforcement recruits informants and cooperating witnesses
from the ranks of people already active within the movements or
organizations being targeted. The government often threatens these
individuals with charges carrying massive jail time, offering to not file
charges in exchange for a promise to inform on others in the movement.
Undercover agents, on the other hand, use false pretenses from the
beginning of their association with any movement or organization.

No specific law governs or limits
law enforcement's use of undercover agents or informants, and
there are no restraints on what
types of crimes infiltration can
be used to investigate. Unlike
other countries, the use of covert
practices do not require a warrant, so law enforcement officers
don't need to show that the use
of an undercover agent or informant is necessary for a particular
investigation. The FBI's use of
undercover agents and informants
is governed only by loose internal
guidelines established after U.S.
Congressional findings in the Final Report of the Select Committee to Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities (1976).
The report exposed details about
the FBI's now-infamous Counter
Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) program, in operation
between 1956 and 1971, which targeted activists and organizations,
including Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. and the Black Panther Party.
In response to the report, the U.S.
Attorney General enacted internal
guidelines for covert FBI operations that regulated both undercover agents and informants.
While these guidelines were

Agents and Informants
Can Do?
initially strong, they have been
progressively weakened by several administrations. The current
guidelines permit many of the
invasive law enforcement practices
they were originally designed to
prevent. Moreover, the guidelines
are not enforceable in court, so
they offer only limited protection
from infiltration and surveillance.
In other words, if an agent gathers
evidence in violations of FBI regulations, that evidence might still be
used in court.
What is Entrapment?
The strongest restraint on undercover agents and informants is the
requirement to avoid entrapment.
Entrapment occurs when an agent
or informant plants the idea to
commit an offense in the mind of
an individual who would not otherwise have been disposed to commit
such an offense and then encourages that individual to commit the
offense in order to prosecute her/
him. Courts view entrapment very
narrowly, and tend to give wide
latitude to undercover agents or informants who suggest or encourage
illegal activity. While exceptions to
the entrapment defense vary from
state to state, it is generally not an
effective defense if the undercover
agent merely suggested the commission of a crime. In many states,
entrapment is not a viable defense
if a jury believes someone was
predisposed to commit the crime.
In other states, entrapment is not


Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Courts have also found that the covert recording of conversations by
undercover agents and informants
does not violate the Fifth Amendment protection against selfincrimination. Similarly, if you
unknowingly invite an undercover
agent into your home or other private space, courts consider it "consent" to a search by that agent. If
the undercover agent sees probable cause of a crime, s/he can
then summon other law enforcement agents to join in the search
based on the so-called consent
granted to the undercover agent.
Some courts have even applied the
same reasoning for situations in
which targets unknowingly invite

a defense at all when the crime
involves "causing or threatening
bodily harm." For these reasons,
one cannot rely on the availability
of an entrapment defense.

What are the
Constitutional Limits
to an Agent's Power to
Infiltrate?
Undercover agents or informants
are generally allowed to attend
public meetings, including those
that take place in houses of worship. Courts have sometimes
found First Amendment violations
when it is determined that enforcement agents interfered with a
group's ability to exercise the right
to freedom of speech and association. Similarly, courts have found
law enforcement in violation of the
First Amendment when it gathers
and publicly releases information on an activist or organization. Courts have not found First
Amendment violations when law
enforcement agents merely create
an uncomfortable atmosphere at
public meetings.
Courts have routinely found that
the covert recording of conversations by undercover agents and
informants does not violate the


There are some helpful clues to
identify an infiltrator. An undercover agent or informant may
volunteer for tasks that provide
access to your group's important
meetings and papers, such as financial records, membership lists,
minutes and confidential files.
Undercover agents and informants
often encourage or urge the use
of violence or illegal tactics and
accuse others who resist those
tactics as being cowards. Similarly,
undercover agents or informants
often accuse others of being agents
or informants, thereby diverting
attention from themselves and distracting the group from its work.
An undercover agent or informant
may also have no obvious source
of income over a period of time or
have more money available than
her/his job should pay.
Try to obtain information on a
suspected agent or informant's
background. Check with organizations in areas the suspected
agent lived in the past to see if
anyone can vouch for her/him.
See what you can turn up on the
Internet. Public records such as
credit reports, voter registration
and mortgages contain a wealth
of information, including past
and present addresses. If they are
available, you might want to check
listings of local police academy
graduates; but, remember that the

Evidence of Infiltration?
suspected person may not be using
her/his real name.
A person who fits these characterizations is not necessarily an undercover agent or informant. Use
caution and do not accuse someone
of being an agent or informant unless you have substantial evidence
against them.
What Precautions Can
I Take to Protect My
Organization?
Maintain a file of all suspected or
confirmed experiences of surveillance and disruption. Include the
date; place; time; those present; a
complete description of everything
that happened; and any comments explaining the context of
the experience and an description
of the impact the event had on the
individual or organization. Hold
a meeting to discuss spying and
harassment, and determine if any
of your members have experienced
any harassment or noticed any
surveillance activities that appear
to be directed at the organization's
activities. Review past suspicious
activities or difficulties in your
group, and try to determine if one
or several people have been involved in many of these events.
You may try to file Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) requests
for your organization from agencies such as the FBI, Department


of Homeland Security (DHS), the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and other federal agencies. File similar requests with
local and state law enforcement
agencies utilizing your state's freedom of information laws.
Most importantly, do not allow
paranoia about infiltration paralyze your movement or organization. Paranoia can be as destructive
as infiltration itself.

This chapter addresses the ways that agents can use telephone wiretaps, bugs and Internet surveillance in their investigations. As our lives
become evermore digitized, agents are increasingly using electronic
surveillance to collect information. Unfortunately, the law and the courts
usually fail to keep up with the pace of technology, which often leads to
unknown or diminished privacy protection for the latest technology.
A good rule of thumb is: the older the means of communication, the
more protection the law affords it. As Elliot Spitzer said when he was
New York State Attorney General, "Never write when you can talk. Never
talk when you can nod. And never put anything in an e-mail because it's
death. You're giving prosecutors all the evidence we need."
When Can the
Government Tap My
Phone Calls?
The government generally needs
a special warrant called a Title III
Wiretap Order to tap your phone.
The government can, however, also
tap your phone without a warrant for 48 hours under certain
emergency situations involving
immediate death or serious injury,
national security or activities

Telephone conversations can be
intercepted in a variety of ways
� from taps to bugs to roving
wiretaps to pen registers to trapand-trace devices. Methods of
telephone surveillance are detailed
and complex and we can only offer
an overview of them here. The lesson, however, is simple � be very
careful about what you say on the
telephone.

The government can later seek a

Title III Wiretap Orders are the warrants that are used to intercept and
monitor your communications. In addition to the Fourth Amendment
protections requiring search warrants for most searches, Congress
provided additional protections regarding oral communication in Title
III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (1968). These
increased protections were passed in response to the Congressional
findings of widespread illegal and abusive surveillance by the FBI in the
1960s (See "Are There Limits on What Undercover Agents and Informants Can Do?").
Agents must file a lengthy Title III application that includes: facts
regarding the crime that has been or is about to be committed; the place
from which communications will be intercepted; the communications
sought to be intercepted; whether other investigative tools have been
utilized and were inadequate or that other tools would be inadequate or
too dangerous to apply; the time frame for interceptions to occur; and
a statement on all previous wiretap applications concerning the same
target or premises.
To issue a Title III Wiretap Order, a judge must find: probable cause
that the target is committing a crime covered under Title III; that communication concerning that crime will be obtained by the interception;
and that the facilities from which communication will be intercepted are
being used in connection with the crime.
Title III Wiretap Orders

Originally, Title III only permitted surveillance for a narrow category
of serious crimes. Over the years, Congress has added more and more
crimes Title III's coverage. Today, the law covers hundreds of crimes, including broad categories such as crimes involving drugs, riots, obscenity or interference with commerce. Such broad interpretations of these
crimes allow for the surveillance of many forms of activism.
Title III Wiretap Orders may initially last for up to 30 days. Law enforcement can return to the judge for repeated 30 day extensions.
After a Title III Wiretap Order expires, the judge can order the government to disclose an inventory of intercepted communications to the
targets of the wiretap. Such an inventory informs the targets of the
time period of the wiretap and whether communications were actually
intercepted. The judge may choose, however, to not require that such an
inventory be issued.
Generally, it is rare practice for law enforcement to seek wiretap orders;
but they almost always get them when they ask. For example, in 2007,
only 2,208 applications for wiretap orders were submitted to the state
and federal courts, but every single application was granted in that
year. The vast majority of the wiretap orders were in narcotics cases
(1,792 out of 2,208 or 81 percent), with the next highest being homicide
and assault cases (132 out of 2,208 or 6 percent).

How Will I Know If
My Phone Is Being
Tapped?
Most likely, you will not know if
your phone is tapped. Government
surveillance has made great strides
since the time when clicks, beeps,
buzzing or any other sound might
tip you off to a tap. The government is generally supposed to tell
you within 90 days after the surveillance ends, but notification can
be postponed with relative ease.

What Is a Roving
Wiretap?
Typically, a wiretap is applied to a
specific phone at a specific location after it has been authorized
through a court order. A roving
wiretap, however, is a tap on any
phone at any location from which
the law enforcement agent believes
the target will be making phone
calls. Roving wiretaps have been
allowed for government use since
1998. The government needs to
meet the same standard for a roving wiretap as they do for a regular
tap � probable cause that a crime
has been or is about to be committed.
A pen register device records the numbers dialed from a telephone line
to which the device is attached. "Trap and trace" devices record the telephone numbers of incoming calls.
A court order is required if law enforcement wants to install and use
either device; however, these court orders are very easy to obtain.
The government needs only to believe that the information likely to be
obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. Judges and
law enforcement typically take a very broad view of what is likely to be
relevant to an investigation. Many states allow such surveillance under
even more lax standards. Also, the U.S. Attorney General can in certain

What About Bugs?
A bug is a miniature electronic
device that can overhear, broadcast and/or record a conversation.
By placing a bug in your home or
office, law enforcement can listen
in on everything that is said within
the device's range. The requirements governing the use of bugs
are generally the same as those for
wiretaps. The use of bugs presents
some inherent difficulties for law
enforcement agents: they must be
installed within the target location;
they are prone to malfunction;
there is a risk of discovery; and
they may be rendered useless by
electrical interference. Because of
these difficulties, bugs are likely
used to a lesser degree than wiretaps.

The government can wiretap both
citizens and noncitizens if there
is probable cause to believe that
the target is a member of a foreign
terrorist group or an agent of a
foreign power. In order to wiretap
citizens and lawful permanent
residents, the government must
also demonstrate probable cause
that the target is engaged in activities that "may" involve a criminal
violation. For this type of surveillance, the government must obtain
a search warrant from the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, a
secret court in which hearings and
records are closed to the public.
The government, via the National
Security Agency (NSA), claims the
authority to warrantlessly monitor
any telephone or electronic communication if it believes one party
is located outside of the U.S. �
even if the other party is inside the
U.S. While the NSA is only authorized to monitor communications
for purposes of obtaining foreign
intelligence, the full scope of the
program is unknown.

"emergency" situations authorize the use of these devices for up to seven
days without seeking an order from the judge.
The Patriot Act expanded the permitted use of both of pen registers and
trap-and-trace devices. Some expanded uses of pen registers and trapand-trace devices include: tracking the physical location of cell phone
users; recording the addresses of Web sites you visit; the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that your computer connects to; or the IP addresses
of computers that connect to your computer. An IP address is a unique
number assigned to each computer or device that connects to a network.

The convenience and ease of cell
phone communication comes with
significant privacy and security
risks. Be aware of the risks inherent in using these devices and
weigh the convenience benefit to
the security risk before each cell
phone use.
The same legal rules that apply
to landlines apply to getting a
tap, pen register or trap-and-trace device on a cell phone. It is
important to note, however, that
anyone with a few hundred dollars
worth of equipment can intercept
your cell phone signals. And, you
shouldn't assume that agents
always follow the law. Individuals
and corporations may also easily
intercept your cell phone signals
with little risk of being caught.
The government has the ability
to turn a cell phone into a listening device or a "roving bug." This
allows the government to hear
any conversations that take place
near the cell phone. The government does not need access to
the cell phone itself to "plant" a
roving bug, but can simply initiate it through your cell phone
company. Roving bugs allow the
government to hear conversations
near your cell phone even when it
is turned off. It appears, however,
that physically removing the battery from a cell phone will disable a
roving bug.
Your cell phone can also be used
to track your location. Whenever
your cell phone is on and has a
signal, it is in contact with one of
more cellular towers in your area.
The government can monitor these
connections to determine your
physical location. In cities and
other areas with a higher density
of cellular towers, your location
can be tracked more precisely,
sometimes within a few yards.
Currently, there is no uniform
legal standard for this kind of cell
phone tracking. Some courts require agents to meet the same low
showing needed to obtain a pen
register or trap-and-trace device
while other courts require agents
to obtain a warrant supported by
probable cause. The government
can also go through your past cell
phone records to determine your
location at that time if your cell
phone was turned on.
Some courts have held that once
you are arrested, law enforcement
can, with a warrant, search the call
history and contacts stored in your
cell phone. Some courts have even
held that, after a lawful arrest,
law enforcement can search text
messages, pictures, e-mails and
any other records contained on
your phone. Some courts allow law
enforcement to search call histoWhat Security Threats

ries without a warrant, with the
argument that the call history will
yield the same information that
can obtained by a pen register,
but require a warrant for searching text messages or e-mails. The
courts are still developing this
area of law; as a result, laws and
regulations vary from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. Enabling password
protection on your cell phone
offers some level of protection
against the security risks inherent
in cell phone usage.

Can the Government
Monitor My Text
Messages?
Text messaging is a considerably
insecure method of communication. Like cell phone conversations,
text messages can be easily intercepted by anyone with the right
equipment. Neither Congress nor
the courts have been clear about
whether probable cause and a warrant are required to intercept text
messages, so law enforcement may
attempt to intercept text messages
using pen registers or trap-and-trace orders which are relatively
easy to obtain. Finally, because
text messages are not considered
"wire communications," they are
not protected by the exclusionary
rule of the Wiretap Act. So even if
the government illegally intercepts
your text messages, it can still use
these communications against you
in a criminal trial.

Law enforcement can easily access
much of your electronic communications and the information they
contain. To obtain a subpoena
to access your electronic communications, the government
needs only to demonstrate that the
information likely to be obtained
is relevant to an ongoing criminal
investigation. With the subpoena,
the government can obtain your
"basic subscriber information,"
which includes the name and
physical address associated with
an account; the length and types of
service used; session logs; and the
IP address of your computer.
The government needs a D Order (see "Know Their Tools: D
Orders") to obtain other "noncontent records," which include
any records or logs that reflect the
e-mail addresses you send e-mail
to or receive e-mail from; times
and dates on which e-mails were
sent or received; and the size of
each e-mail.
Regarding e-mail stored by a third
party, such as a Web e-mail service
or an Internet Service Provider
(ISP), different protections apply
depending on how recent an e-mail
is and whether or not you have
read it. The Stored CommunicaInternet Communications

Can the Government
Read My E-mail?
tions Act requires law enforcement
to obtain a search warrant for the
content (subject line and body) of
unopened emails that have been
in storage for less than 180 days.
For unopened e-mails older than
180 days and for opened e-mails
in storage by the third party, the
government can obtain a D Order
or issue a subpoena for the content
of the emails. The government can
also choose to get a search warrant
for emails older than 180 days or
opened emails.
In Alaska, Arizona, California,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington, which are
states covered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, courts have
disagreed with the government's
interpretation that it can, with a D
Order, obtain opened e-mails that
has been in storage for less than
180 days. These courts have ruled
that the government needs a warrant for any e-mail that is less than
180 days old.
The government is supposed to
give the individual subscriber prior
notice before using D Orders or
subpoenas to obtain the content of
email. In theory this would allow
the subscriber to move to quash
the subpoena before the thirdparty complies with it. Another
provision of the Stored Communications Act, however, allows law
enforcement to delay notice of a D
order or subpoena for a substantial period of time, and it appears
the government regularly delays
notice. Law enforcement can also
avoid giving you any notice by taking the extra steps required for a
search warrant.
Larger ISPs reportedly receive
more than 1,000 subpoenas each
month seeking information about
their users. Most of the subpoenas
request users' names, addresses,
ISP addresses and records of when
the target signed on and off of the
Internet.
There are many reports of law
enforcement programs designed to
capture vast amounts of Internet
traffic, including e-mails and Web
activity. The extent of these programs, their permitted use and the
admissibility of any information
obtained through them in court is
currently unknown.
Can the Government

Another law enforcement tool is the 2307(D) Order, commonly referred
to as a "D Order." The D Order gets its name from the subsection of the
Stored Communications Act that authorizes them. The government uses
D Orders to obtain electronic records stored by third parties � most
often, email. D Orders are harder to get than a simple subpoena but
easier to obtain than a search warrant. To obtain a D Order, the government must provide specific facts to a judge showing there are reasonable grounds to believe the information sought is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. So the suspicion required for the D Order is
lower than probable cause, but it is higher than the standard of "any
reasonable possibility" required in order to obtain a subpoena.

Can the Government
Tell What Web Sites I
Visit?
Law enforcement needs a warrant
for records of the actual Web sites
you visit. The government can
reportedly obtain the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) addresses,
e.g. http://ccrjustice.org, of Web
sites you viewed without a warrant; but, the government needs
a warrant to obtain information
on specific pages you visit on Web
site, e.g., http://ccrjustice.org/ifanagentknocks.


Corporate spying is likely a larger
industry than government spying. Corporations routinely hire
private spies, most of whom are
former law enforcement agents,
to conduct surveillance of activists
who may threaten their interests.
Corporate spying involves many
of the same tactics employed by
the government, including: rummaging through trash; tapping
telephones; monitoring Internet
activity; and using infiltrators. Corporate spies are probably less likely
to be concerned by legal restraints
on spying.

The National Security Letter (NSL) is tool used by the FBI to secretly
demand information about an individual from a third party, such as a
telephone company, ISP, consumer credit agency or financial institution. NSLs require no probable cause or oversight � the FBI only needs
to believe the information they seek is relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation. The NSL law has a built-in gag rule that prohibits
someone who receives an NSL from telling anyone except their attorney
that they have received one. Though a recent court ruling found the
permanent, built-in gag rule unconstitutional, its future application
remains unclear.
Government studies have reported that the FBI issues tens of thousands
of NSLs a year, and often violates even the minor restraints on their
authority to issue these letters. Data from NSLs is shared within the U.S.
intelligence community, other government agencies and even foreign
governments.
If you or an organization you work with receives a NSL, contact an attorney immediately.

Electronic security is an immense and complex topic. This section
introduces some basic advice regarding electronic security. You will
find more in-depth information on each of these topics in the Additional
Resources section of this booklet.
Simply put, the most secure electronic communication is no electronic

weigh risks against rewards when deciding what electronic security
measures to employ.

Encryption is a method of turning information into a ciphered
code. If used properly, encryption
protects your data from being
viewed by anyone who does not
have the proper "key" to view it.
Modern encryption technology is
strong enough so that it is virtually impossible for the government to unscramble encrypted
messages without the use of keys.
Encryption is the strongest protection you have to prevent the
government from obtaining your
electronic data.
Widely available programs allow
you to encrypt all of the data on
your hard drive. Simple passwords to login to your computer
are not enough to protect your
hard drive. The government can
take the hard drive, make a copy
of it and easily access the data
without your log-in. With an
encrypted hard drive, your files
will be encoded and the government will not be able to access
them without your encryption
password.
Encryption programs also allow for encryption of individual
files or folders. While this may
be easier to manage, piecemeal
encryption may allow for additional vulnerabilities to those
files. A better solution is to keep
a separate, fully encrypted hard
drive for sensitive files.
Data Encryption


Electronic Security
Know Your Tools
Using encryption is even more
important for e-mail. We've already shown how the government
can use D Orders or subpoenas
to easily access your e-mails or
use other tools to intercept them
in transmission. And, once an
e-mail is on a third party's computer, you have no control over
who can get it and read it. Similar
to data encryption, one tool to
protect your electronic communications is e-mail encryption.
In order to use e-mail encryption
effectively, however, both you and
whoever you are communicating with must use an encryption
program.
E-mail encryption ensures that
only the intended recipients can
read the e-mail you send. Modern
e-mail encryption works through
a system of "public keys." A
public key provides instructions,
or the code, for how e-mails sent
to you should be scrambled. The
code to unscramble messages �
the "private key" � is different
from the public key, and only
you have access to the private
key. If your e-mails are intercepted through a subpoena, court
order or otherwise, the messages
contained therein cannot be unscrambled without your private
key.
While the more technical aspects
of e-mail encryption are too
detailed to include in this booklet,
a simple analogy to encryption is
an open door that can be locked
by anyone but can be opened only
by someone with a special key.
E-mail encryption is easier to
use today than it was in the past.
GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a
free program that can be integrated into most major e-mail
programs. For example, the third
party mail client Mozilla Thunderbird offers a plug-in, also
known as a security extension,
called Enigmail that is compatible
with GnuPG and makes encryption fairly easy to use.

What are
Grand Juries
and What
Threats Do
They Pose to
Activists?
A grand jury is a panel of citizens
brought together to investigate
crimes and issue indictments. In
their original conception, grand
juries were intended to be radically democratic. In
England, they served
as a buffer between
citizens and the
monarch and her/his
prosecutors. In early
America, any citizen
could bring an allegation of wrongdoing
to the original grand
jury and the grand
jury could indict on a
majority vote.
Modern day grand
juries are very different. Today,
all cases are brought to a grand
jury by a prosecutor. The prosecutor picks the witnesses and asks
the questions. Witnesses are not
allowed to have a lawyer present. There is no judge present.
The prosecutor drafts the charges
and reads them to the grand jury.
There is no requirement that the
grand jury members be instructed
on the law at issue. And, unlike in
other juries, grand jury members
are not screened for bias.
Since the prosecutor
solely orchestrates
the proceedings, it
is no surprise that
grand juries almost
always serve as a
rubber stamp for
prosecution. A former
chief judge of New
York once famously
noted that "any prosecutor that wanted
to could indict a ham
sandwich." In the rare
event that a grand
jury does not indict, the prosecutor can simply impanel a different
grand jury and seek an indictment
before a new grand jury.
In political cases, grand juries
have been used to execute witch
hunts against activists. Prosecutors will bring in activist witnesses
and attempt to get them to snitch

on other activists with threats of
jail time if they refuse to cooperate
with the grand jury. It is critical
to understand how a grand jury
works; what your rights are; what
rights you cannot exercise; and
how to resist a grand jury.
Many rights we take for granted do
not exist for grand jury witnesses.
Grand jury witnesses have no right
to be represented by an attorney
and no right to a jury trial if they
are threatened with jail. Grand
jury witnesses do retain the right
against self-incrimination but can
nonetheless be forced to snitch on
themselves and others in exchange
for immunity from prosecution
and punishment. Immunity only
protects witnesses � others can
still be prosecuted.

and What Threats Do
They Pose to Activists?

Grand jury subpoenas are served
by law enforcement agents, usually
police officers or federal marshals.
A grand jury subpoena must be
personally served on you, meaning, it must be handed to you. If
you refuse to accept it, it must be
placed near you.
A grand jury subpoena does not
give an agent the right to search
a home, office, car or anywhere
else, nor does it require you to
relinquish any documents or say
anything at that time. A grand jury
subpoena is only requires you to
do something on the future date
stated on the subpoena.
If an agent shows up and tries to
serve you with a subpoena, take
it and do not do anything else. Do
not answer any questions; do not
consent to a search; and do not
invite them into your home for any
reason.

What Options Do I
Have If I Receive a

Once you have received a grand
jury subpoena, you typically have
three options: 1) You can comply
with the subpoena; 2) you can
move to quash the subpoena; or
3) you can refuse to comply. If you
receive a subpoena, you should
contact an attorney as soon as
possible and discuss each of these
options in detail.
Complying with a subpoena is
relatively straightforward. For a
subpoena ad testificandum, you
arrive at the date, time and location stated on the subpoena and
answer the prosecutor's questions.
For a subpoena duces tecum, you
show up on the date, time and loGrand juries get information from people by issuing subpoenas. A grand
jury subpoena is an order to testify before a grand jury or provide the
grand jury with certain information. Grand juries issue different types
of subpoenas for testimony and information. A subpoena ad testificandum, or testifying, is a subpoena ordering a witness to appear and give
testimony. A subpoena duces tecum, which means "bring it with you"
in Latin, is a subpoena ordering a witness to provide the grand jury
with certain documents. Grand juries also use these orders to obtain
fingerprints and handwriting samples. Grand juries often issue both
subpoenas to the same witness so they can obtain both documents and
testimony.
Grand Jury Subpoenas

cation stated on the subpoena with
the documents or other evidence
required.
If you comply with a subpoena,
you avoid the possibility of being
punished for ignoring it; however, complying with a subpoena
may get you into a different type
of trouble. For example, if you
are a target of the investigation,
complying with the subpoena may
provide the government with information it might need to charge
and convict you. You might also
place another activist in jeopardy
by complying with a subpoena.
If you receive a subpoena, you
should speak with a lawyer before
taking any action. If the subpoena
is politically motivated, it is best
to speak with an attorney in your
activist circle who does criminal
defense or grand jury work. Some


non-activist criminal defense attorneys may suggest you become
a snitch. It is important to note,
however, that many snitches end
up serving as many years in prison
as the individuals on whom they
snitched.
Grand jury proceedings are secret.
The activist community often does
not know when a grand jury investigation is being pursued. As a
result, many activists believe that
they should publicize the fact that
they have received a subpoena.
This may be an effective tactic to
explore with your attorney if you
receive a subpoena.
What Options Do I

You can challenge a subpoena in
court by a motion to quash the
subpoena. Quashing a subpoena
means a court declares it null and
void. A court will only grant a motion to quash if there is a sufficient
legal basis, such as misidentification; lack of jurisdiction; a protected privilege; or an unlawful basis
of the proceedings.
Even if you cannot successfully

quash a subpoena, litigating a
motion to quash in court can buy
you some time. Time is important, especially if you do not plan
to cooperate with the grand jury,
because non-cooperation can land
you in jail. Grand juries can last
for as long as 18 months; whatever
time is spent litigating the motion
to quash may save you the experience of spending that entire period
in jail.
While there is little to lose by filing a motion to quash a subpoena
duces tecum, the subpoenas that
demand evidence, motions to
quash subpoenas ad testificandum, which demand testimony,
can present problems. At least one
federal circuit court ruled that you
lose any objections that was not
raised in the original motion to
quash. You should not waive your
objections, especially because you
may not know what your objections are until you are asked a
particular question.
A good political attorney should be
able to provide advice on whether
moving to quash a subpoena is a
good idea or not in your particular
circumstances.


There are two basic ways to refuse to comply with a grand jury
subpoena: 1) refuse to show up;
and 2) refuse to answer any of the
prosecutor's questions.
If you simply refuse to show up
for your testimony, you may be in
contempt and the government can
choose to arrest you and jail you
until you testify or until the grand
jury expires. If your testimony is
not particularly important to the
prosecutor, they may choose not to
take action.

tions by saying "I invoke my Fifth
Amendment privilege against selfincrimination" after every question. At this point, the prosecutor
may simply dismiss you or s/he
may seek to grant you immunity.
Immunity prevents the witness
from having criminal charges
brought on the basis of the grand
jury testimony. A judge must
approve a grant of immunity. A
prosecutor can get a judge to preapprove a grant of immunity; otherwise, a witness is brought before
a judge who, upon the prosecutor's
request, virtually always grants
immunity.
If you continue to refuse to answer
questions after being granted immunity, the prosecutor can bring
you before a judge, and the judge
will order you to testify. If you
continue to refuse, the judge can
have you jailed for civil contempt.
Witnesses who refuse to provide
physical exemplars, i.e. samples of
handwriting, hair, appearance in
a lineup or documents, upon the
request of a grand jury may also be
jailed for civil contempt.
While civil contempt is not a
crime, it can result in the witness
being jailed for the duration of
the grand jury. Grand juries can
last for up to 18 months, although
some "special" grand juries can
obtain up to three extensions of six
month periods each. The purpose
of incarcerating a recalcitrant
witness is to coerce her/him to

If you appear to testify, you will
not be allowed to have an attorney
present. You can, however, have
an attorney just outside the grand
jury room, and you can consult
with her/him after every question,
although some courts have ruled
you can only consult your attorney
after every few questions.

Amendment right against selfincrimination, you can refuse to

testify. Judges will sometimes free
witnesses before the expiration of
the jury if it is clear that there is no
chance the witness will testify.
The government can also use the
charge of "criminal contempt"
against uncooperative grand jury
witnesses. Criminal contempt
carries no maximum penalty �
the sentence depends entirely on
the judge's discretion. While civil
contempt is meant to coerce a witness to testify, criminal contempt
is meant to punish a witness for
impeding the legal process. As
with any other crime, criminal
contempt requires notice of the
charges, the right to receive assistance of counsel, and proof beyond
a reasonable doubt. Charges of
criminal contempt are extremely
rare.
If you are jailed, you can periodically file a motion stating that: 1)
jail will not coerce you into testifying; and 2) your confinement is
merely punitive and therefore
unconstitutional. If you win one of
these motions, you will be released.
Some activists create files to
prepare for being called before a
grand jury. A file that memorializes your stalwart belief against
cooperating with grand jury proceedings can be used as evidence
that civil contempt will not work
to coerce you and thereby help you
win release.

(continued...)
What Happens After a
Grand Jury?
What takes place in grand jury
proceedings is secret. The government relies on this secrecy to
create fear and distrust in activist
communities. Some activists have
successfully dispelled that fear
and distrust in activist comities
by publishing the questions asked
of them by the prosecutor and the
answers they provided. If you are
considering taking action in this
way, you must talk with an attorney to ensure that you are not
creating more problems than you
are solving.

In most cases, the government
treats speech by noncitizens in
the same way it treats speech by
citizens. Noncitizens cannot be
criminally punished for speech that
would be protected if uttered by a
citizen. Similarly, noncitizens cannot be sued for speech that would
be protected if said by a citizen.
The government does, however,
have broad powers to withhold
immigration benefits (such as discretionary relief or naturalization)
and may potentially even initiate
removal proceedings based on a
noncitizen's speech. It is unclear
whether the government can
remove a noncitizen or withhold
discretionary benefits for speech
or political association alone.
Fifty years ago, some courts found
the government could, but First
Amendment law has changed dramatically since then, and courts are
now split on whether that rule is
still good law. Practically speaking,
it is extremely rare for the government to remove someone based
purely on speech or association.
The government, however, is
allowed to selectively enforce immigration laws. For instance, the
government can remove noncitiNoncitizens are individuals who do not have U.S. citizenship, including
tourists, students and others who are in the U.S. on visas or visa waiver
programs; lawful permanent residents; refugees; and those without
legal immigration status. Noncitizens in the U.S. share most of the same
constitutional rights as citizens. There are some exceptions to that rule,
and noncitizens engaging in political activism should be aware of several
special considerations. Noncitizens should not, however, entirely avoid
political activism based on an unreasonable fear of government repression.

law (such as overstaying a visa or

even if the government's motivation in initiating removal proceedings is a noncitizen's speech or
political association.

sible in immigration proceedings.
This means the government can
use illegally obtained evidence
that cannot be used in criminal
proceedings for immigration proceedings. It is possible that evidence obtained through especially
egregious violations of the Fourth
Amendment may be excluded in
immigration proceedings.
Also, the government can generally
search and seize any person, package or vehicle traveling across the
border or at an airport.

Noncitizens largely enjoy the same
Fourth Amendment protections
against unreasonable searches
and seizures that citizens do. Law
enforcement must get a warrant to
perform any search on a noncitizen
or a noncitizen's property just as
they must to perform a search on a
citizen. Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment
is excluded from a noncitizen's
criminal trial the same way it is for
citizens.
Unfortunately, the use of evidence
obtained in violation of the Fourth
Amendment is generally permisSearches and Seizures
Right to Remain Silent
Noncitizens generally have the
same right to remain silent that
citizens do. If questioned by law
enforcement agents, you can
remain silent and refuse to answer
their questions even if they detain
you temporarily or arrest you.
You can simply say nothing or say
something like "I'd like to talk to
my lawyer before I say anything to
you," or "I have nothing to say to
you. I will talk to my lawyer and
have her/him contact you." Do not
sign anything without reading and
fully understanding the consequences of signing it.
One exception to this rule is if an
immigration officer asks a noncitizen to provide information related
to her/his immigration status;
however, even in this situation, you
can still state that you would like a
lawyer present before you answer
any questions.

As noted before, the information presented in this booklet is a primer on
your basic rights. This guide is meant to help you prepare yourself, your
organization and your fellow activists to be fully informed and protected
in the event that an agent knocks at your door. And remember, different
states have different laws � it is a good idea to learn the laws of your state
and to have access to a lawyer who is familiar with them.
We hope this booklet can be a tool for you and your organization as we
work towards a more socially just world.

The law also requires adult noncitizens with have valid immigration documents to carry these
documents at all times. If an agent
asks for your documents and you
refuse to provide them, you can be
charged with a misdemeanor.
Never show fake immigration
papers or claim that you are a U.S.
citizen if you are not. Instead, you
should remain silent or say you
would like to talk to a lawyer. Lying
to a federal agent is a much more
serious crime than the misdemeanor of failing to produce documents � it is better not to produce
anything than to produce false
documents. Also, falsely claiming
to be a citizen may bar you from
obtaining lawful status or citizenship in the future.
